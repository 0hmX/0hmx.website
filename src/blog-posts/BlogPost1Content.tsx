        I wish I could say I was an internet native, but I'm not. I joined the
        internet in 2017, a time when a YouTube channel with 30 million
        subscribers was considered insane. To be honest, I still can't believe
        that in 2025, we have channels like MrBeast with over 400 million subs.
        Can you even imagine how huge that number is?
      </p>

      <p>
        Back then, only a few singers like Ed Sheeran, Drake, and Selena Gomez
        were hitting numbers like that on YouTube. Now, it feels like everyone
        has 30M+ subs. Of course, we also had the legend himself, PewDiePie, and
        my country's rising star, T-Series. The reason I wanted to become a tech
        YouTuber was that I thought it would guarantee me a job and that people
        would look up to me. Now that I've gotten older, I've realized some
        parts of that are truer than others.

        Okay, as I'm typing this, my hands are starting to hurt. It just goes to
        show what a toll relying on LLMs has taken on me; I can't even type
        anymore.

        I first discovered ThePrimeagen because of his Vim setups. I started
        with the OG, Luke Smith, but then life happened, and I forgot about it.
        By the time I looked again, ThePrimeagen had completely taken over my
        feed. Then came Theo, who was at, like, 2k subs back then. I used to
        watch his "brainrot" daily tech news, which was surprisingly useful,
        especially since I was writing zero lines of code a day.

        When I started my first year of college in 2022, I got detached from
        tech YouTube for almost a year. When I came back, oh god, it felt like
        there were 100k+ new channels. Who were these people? Who was watching
        them?
      </p>

      <p>
        I also tried to make some YouTube videos around this time, but that all
        collapsed because I spent way too much time in the hostel just talking
        with my friends about everythingâ€”coding, jobs, sex, every fucking
        thing.
      </p>

        Frankly, I don't want to expose my entire life here, so I'll end this
        post. But the "Prime/Theo effect" is unreal, and "Approved by Theo" is a
        real phenomenon now. You can literally go from a nobody account to
        getting 10k views on every tweet just because Theo shared your profile.

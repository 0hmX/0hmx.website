        When I dropped out of college nine credits shy of graduation, everyone thought I was crazy.
        But I had a vision and a $199 screen printing kit from eBay. That small investment taught me
        more about business than any textbook ever could.

        The beauty of starting small is that failure doesn't cost much, but the lessons are
        invaluable. Every mistake became a stepping stone, every small win built confidence. That
        burned copy of Photoshop and basic equipment forced me to be creative, resourceful, and
        determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I want to share the lessons I learned from that humble beginning and how you can
        apply them to your own entrepreneurial journey.

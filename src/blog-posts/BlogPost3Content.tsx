      <p>In a world obsessed with credentials, I've built my career on something different: authenticity, hard work, and genuine value creation. Not having a degree forced me to prove myself through results, not certificates.</p>
      <p>Your personal brand isn't about having the perfect resume or the right connections. It's about consistently delivering value, being true to your story, and connecting with people who share your values.</p>
      <p>I'll share the strategies I've used to build a strong personal brand and how you can do the same, regardless of your educational background.</p>

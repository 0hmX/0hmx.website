        Design isn't just about making things look pretty. It's about solving problems, creating
        experiences, and connecting with people on an emotional level. As someone who started with
        no formal design education, I've learned that good design principles are accessible to
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key is understanding your audience, defining the problem clearly, and iterating based on
        feedback. Whether you're designing a logo, a website, or a business strategy, the same
        principles apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, I'll walk you through my design process and share practical tips that have
        helped me create successful brands and products.
